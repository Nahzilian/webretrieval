Running the program:

- To run the program:
    - Install nltk
    - In command prompt, type: python display.py (Make sure your python version is 3.8)
    - All the program result will be display according to the given options

Report:

Objective: To understand Vector space model and gaining experience building a complete information retrieval system
There will be 4 main programs that take place in the process of making the retrieval system:
- invert
- search
- eval
- display

Invert program:
Objective: To convert given data into sets of document for information retrieval.
The program will pick up the given raw data files and execute data processing to clean up and get all given documents.
There will be 3 files generated after running the program: 
- posting_list - List will all the document, divided into each subsections, such as the title, abstract, data, author and customed
sub-section such as words pool and word counter
- dictionary - How many times a word occurred in all documents
- lookup - containing all the information on which word occur in which document 
These file will be used as the temporary data storage, storing related information to the retrieval system, such as a
dictionary of words with their occurrence in the data, the closest position to the words and so on.

Posting list is based on the document ID, however due to the structure of dictionary in python (Which is an implementation of 
hashmap), the data will be retrieve with the runtime of O(n)
To assist the data storage, all 3 files will be in JSON format. This would be easier to load and dissect the context within it.

Search program:
Based on the Vector space model. There will be 3 main procedure occered in the process of searching:
- Retrieve relevant documents (Using all 3 created files)
- Calculation
- Ranking based on cosine similarity

The program will return the id of relevant documents. The method of finding is to get all documents that has similar terms within its context.

Evaluation program:
There will be 2 main evaluation, one is R-Precision, the other is Mean average precision.
R-Precision: Because some queries will return a huge amount of data, the program will be fixed base on how many relevant documents occur
MAP: Will be calculated normally based on found documents

Display program:
It will display all the previous program on demand. Setting could also be changed based on user's desire, such as not using stem or not using stop word removal
